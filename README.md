## Description

### The Problem

In today's digital age, people seek platforms to share their lives and connect with others through photos and videos. Many existing platforms are cluttered with advertisements, lack privacy controls, and have limited engagement features. Users need a modern, clean, and user-friendly platform that focuses on genuine interactions and privacy.

### Our Solution

Our social media website addresses these issues by providing a seemless UI and privacy protection. It allows users to:
- Share high-quality photos and videos.
- Like on posts.
- View media from people they follow.

## Plans for Improving the Project

- **Adding interactive UI**: With javascript we can add a listener for the heart to turn red or change button for it to say subscribe.
